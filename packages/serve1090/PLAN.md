sorting arrivals and departures list in a meaningful way

for arrivals:

define a lat/long coord pair TERMINUS at the runway terminus of each region
sort all aircraft in the REGION (not runway) according to the distance between them and TERMINUS
we have now sorted in order of TO ARRIVE; classify aircraft in arrival region and in runway as ARRIVED

this should be the same no matter which region is used

for departures:

we want to rank next to depart
