# serve1090

### Overview

`serve1090` scaffolds an `express` server for receiving `dump1090` data via WebSocket; filtering, validating, and aggregating it into an API; and finally, for performing geospatial work using aircraft data to determine which airspaces they are located in and which aircraft are currently arriving or departing a specified airport. Further features are under active development.

### Prerequisites

1. [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Node as defined in `.nvmrc` (recommend using `nvm`) if running the `express` server outside of a Docker container
3. From the repo root, run `chmod +x scripts/setup.sh && ./scripts/setup.sh` and follow prompts

### Installation and execution

`yarn serve` (`docker-compose up -d --build`) will start the entire `serve1090` stack within two `docker` containers, one for the `express` server and one for KeyDB.

`yarn serve:dev` will run *KeyDB only* in a `docker` container and start the `express` server with `nodemon` to support hot reloading.

It is possible to directly run `keydb-cli` against the KeyDB instance. SSH into the KeyDB Docker container and run `keydb-cli -a KEYDB_PASSWORD` where `KEYDB_PASSWORD` is the password generated by `setup.sh` and stored in `.env`.

See [package.json](package.json) for more info.

### KeyDB and Redis

`serve1090` depends on [KeyDB](https://github.com/JohnSully/KeyDB), a high performance fork of [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) with some extra features that are particularly useful for keeping and constantly refreshing an updated data stream of aircraft. Specifically, `serve1090` leverages the `EXPIREMEMBER` command unique to KeyDB that allows for an individual member of a hash or set to be given an expiration time, something that is not possible in Redis and saves a lot of complicated store logic to purge out stale aircraft as the fly out of range of the dependent `dump1090` receiver(s).

`serve1090` will fail to persist aircraft without a properly configured instance of KeyDB exposed on port 6379 (see [keydb.conf](keydb.conf)).
